Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Craig, a passionate comic book fan and the creator of this website dedicated to the Awesome Comics Podcast Recommends. As an ardent lover of comics, I wanted to contribute to the vibrant ACP community. That's why I decided to establish this website, where I can share my enthusiasm for the Awesome Comics Podcast. I always forget about the great books the team recommend and thought this would serve as a great reminder. 

It's important to note that this website is purely a fan endeavor, and there is absolutely no profit gained from its operation. The purpose of this platform is to connect fellow ACP lovers with outstanding comics that the team recommend. You won't find any affiliate links here. Any links included are solely intended to help you discover and explore the vast world of comics. This website is driven by a genuine love for the art form and a desire to contribute positively to the comic book community.

So, join me on this exciting journey, where we celebrate the captivating narratives, vibrant artwork, and extraordinary creators that make the world of comics so fantastic. Remember, it's all about staying awesome!

I hope you all find this helpful and if you have any feedback on how I can make the site better, please email me.

Thanks

Craig
